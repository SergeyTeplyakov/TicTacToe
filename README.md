# Tic Tac Toe

Very simple Tic Tac Toe implementation based on popular [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) which is a clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Written for fun in TypeScript to get some familiarity with this language.

You can play in two version of the game:
* [Classical tic tac toe](http://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/tictactoe)
* [Five in a row](http://sergeyteplyakov.github.io/fiveinarow) (with non-canonical field size - 10x10).
